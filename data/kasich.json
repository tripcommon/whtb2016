Kasich spoke with reporters in Columbus just hours after returning from a whirlwind trip with President Clinton and other dignitaries to assess Bosnian politics and bolster the morale of U.S.  troops there. Clinton, who announced earlier the troops would stay 'indefinitely' beyond the original June 30 deadline, organized the 36-hour trip that included a bipartisan delegation of 11 members of Congress; Secretary of State Madeline Albright; former Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican who ran against Clinton; Dole's wife, Elizabeth, the president of the American Red Cross; and the president's wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea.",
