The Auditor caught up with Christie in London a couple days ago, after the U.S. attorney and his family took in not one but two shows on the European leg of Springsteen's tour. Christie, his wife, Mary Pat , and their four children caught The Boss first in Paris and then in London, between taking in sights such as the Louvre. \u2018Bruce, in Paris, was amazing,\u2019 said Christie, who's seen Springsteen in concert nearly 100 times. \u2018The audience was pretty wild.",
