And even though The Boss was thousands of miles and an ocean away last week, that didn't deter the federal lawman. The Auditor caught up with Christie in London a couple days ago, after the U.S. attorney and his family took in not one but two shows on the European leg of Springsteen's tour. Christie, his wife, Mary Pat , and their four children caught The Boss first in Paris and then in London, between taking in sights such as the Louvre. ‘Bruce, in Paris, was amazing,’ said Christie, who's seen Springsteen in concert nearly 100 times. ‘The audience was pretty wild."
