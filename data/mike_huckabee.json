Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., issued the following column: After I return from visiting with Arkansans serving in the military abroad, I like to mention these men and women by name when writing about my trip. These soldiers have put their lives on hold - and in extreme danger - to serve their country. Their actions deserve praise and notoriety. Following my recent visit to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, however, I was told that I could not mention the names of the Arkansans I met serving there. These Arkansans, who guard detainees with ties to terrorists, run the risk of retribution from terrorists if their names are mentioned. The U.S. military believes the lives of their family members back home might be in jeopardy if their identities were known.” [Press Release, Governor Mike Huckabee, 4/26/06]"
